       "[Document(page_content='1 \\n  \\n \\nPART I  \\nGENERAL GUIDELINES  \\n \\n1) Visa c ategory  \\nThere are two categories  for student visa s: F-1 and M -1. The F -1 visa permits students to enrol  \\nfor a full -time program  of academic study, leading to a degree such as bachelor s, master s or a \\ndoctorate . The M -1 visa is for non -academic or vocational education  for a duration that is less \\nthan a year , and it includes programs of study in fields such as G emology, Aviation, L anguage \\nstudies, etc. All students join ing Dilip Oak’s Academy apply for the F-1 visa.  \\n \\n2) Responses from universities  \\nTypically,  you will start getting responses from the universities within three to four months after \\nsending your application packets. You can accept all the admissions and request for I -20 forms. \\nEven if you accept admission and the I-20 from a particular university, it is not compulsory to join \\nthat university.  \\n \\n3) Bank certificate  \\n \\nNowadays, the majority of the universities do not demand bank balance certificate at \\nthe time of applications but they may request for it after confirming your admission \\nand before releasing the I -20 form.  \\n \\nMost  universities demand the actual bank balance certificate for the amount that is equal to the \\ntotal cost of one year before releasing the I -20. In such cases, the sponsor has to deposit funds \\nin their bank accounts  before acquiring the bank balance certificate. The sponsor can include all \\nthe bank accounts (i.e. savings, fixed dep osits and PPF) . If he/she  has accounts in more than \\none bank, he /she can obtain  certificates from all these banks , preferably , on the same date.  \\n \\nSome universities also accept educational loan certificates issued by banks/financial institutions \\nin the place of a bank certificate.  \\n \\n4) Admission deposit  \\nSome universities demand a deposit before issuing the I -20. For example, SUNY Binghamton \\ndemands $100  and S anta Clara University demands $3 00. If the university has not set a clear \\ndeadline for the payment of this deposit, you should wait till you finalise the university. However, \\nsome universities do set a deadline for the payment. In that case, send a r equest email to the \\nuniversity and try to extend this date as much as possible.  \\n \\n5) Final decision regarding the university  \\nAfter receiving replies from all the universities, you have to decide which university you wish to \\njoin. You may contact our office and  get the email IDs of our former students  (previous two years) \\nand students who are currently studying at the university , and receive feedback from them \\nregarding courses available, costs, and job opportunities after graduation, before you make up \\nyour mind.  \\n \\n6) Checking accuracy of information of I -20 \\nIt is important to check the accuracy of the information printed on the I -20 form , especially : \\n\\uf0b7 full name of the student, date of birth, country of origin, name  of the university and program', metadata={'source': 'VisaDocuments.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='DILIP OAK’S ACADEMY  \\n \\n2 \\n  \\n\\uf0b7 date of commencement  of the program , date of completion , and the duration  \\n1. In case  of mistakes , contact the university immediately and reques t for the corrected I -20 \\nform. Generally, in most I -20 forms , the estimated average cost is given for nine months \\nas two semesters are completed  in that much time,  and the remaining three months \\nconstitute the summer break. However , some universities also mention the cost for 12 \\nmonths instead of nine.  \\nSimilarly, the normal program duration  is stated  as 24 months , but in some cases , they mention \\nit as 21 months , or even 36 months. Either way, students are expected to show financial backup \\nfor one year  only.  \\n \\n 7)  The actual cost incurred for the entire program  \\nStudents should use the following formula to calculate the cost , irrespective of the amount \\ndisplayed  on the I-20 form. The full tuition fee  for the first year , plus 70 percent of the tuition fee \\nfor  the second year , plus $10 ,000, which is  the living cost for the first year. The living cost \\nmentioned on the I -20 form is calculated in keeping with the American standard of living. \\nHowever , Indian students usually manage with just $10,000 per year. In the second year , they \\nearn this amount by taking up a campus job.   \\n \\n8) Applying for student visa  \\nYou need to appear at the US Consulate in person for the  visa interview . The decision to grant or \\ndeny an F1 visa is taken  on the basis of  the individual assessment by the consulate officer who \\ninterviews you.  \\n \\n9) Visa application fee  \\nThe present visa application fee is $185 payable in cash ($1 = Rs. 84), which is Rs. 15,540 \\n(subject to change without prior notification. Please confirm on www.ustraveldocs.com  at the time of \\nscheduling a visa appointment) . This fee is payable in cash at any branch of Axis Bank.  \\n \\nAt the time of payment of the fee at the bank, please carry the ‘R eceipt for Payment ,’ which \\nincludes the ‘CGI Reference Number’ required to pay the visa fee. Without the ‘CGI Reference \\nNumber ,’ you will not be permitted to pay the visa fee.  \\n \\nThe bank will issue a visa fee receipt, which  includes the ‘Receipt Number’ . This receipt has a \\n‘Bank Reference Number ,’ which is required to schedule an appointment.  \\n \\n10) SEVIS charges  \\nThe Student and Exchange Visitor Information Service (SEVIS) has been introduced  by the \\nImmigration and Naturali sation Service (INS). SEVIS entails  the following:  \\nI. Universities must be registered  under SEVIS.  \\nII. I-20 of such universities will have a SEVIS ID, which will also be recorded  with SEVIS \\nand will be accessible to the  consulate and the immigration officer at the port of entry.  \\n \\nBefore appearing for the F-1 visa interview at the consulate , you need to pay SEVIS charges of \\nUS $ 350. This fee must be paid in time to ensure that the payment can be deposited and recorded \\nin SEVIS prior to  the scheduled visa interview. To allow for adequate processing time , the fee \\nmust be paid at least two working days prior to  the visa. This amount should be paid  through \\ncredit card by accessing www.fm jfee.com . You will have to fill  an online form and  print the SEVIS \\nfee receipt immediately . In case you fail to print the receipt at the time of payment, you can retrieve \\nit by clicking on the ‘Check I -901 Status’  button to reprint the receipt.  \\n \\nNote : Without a valid SEVIS fee receipt you will NOT be permitted to attend the visa interview.', metadata={'source': 'VisaDocuments.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Financial Resources  \\n Your s ponsor is required to show liquid assets equal to the total cost of education for one year \\nmentioned in the I -20 form. If a student has received full financial aid, he or she is required to show \\nonly Rs. 2,00,000 to Rs. 3,00,000 in the bank account. On the other hand, if he or she has received \\npartial financial aid, he or she is required to show backup for the uncovered po rtion. L iquid assets \\ninclude funds in the bank  (savings, recurring, and fixed deposits), postal savings, education loan, \\nPublic Provident Fund, Gen eral Provident Fund, shares, mutual funds, etc. Ideally , the amount should \\nbe at least 10 to 20  percent  more than that mentioned in the I -20 form. For an education loan,  you \\nwould need to show the official documents of the loan approval. Most students take an education \\nloan of up to Rs. 4 5,00,000.  \\n \\n Passbooks/account statements of savings accounts must have several entries. It is better to start \\ntransferring funds into your account one month in advance. You cannot deposit a lump -sum amount \\nwithin a few days unless you have a valid proof (e.g. sale of fixed assets, shares). Cash deposits of \\na large amount should be avoided since the visa officer may ask for evidence of the source \\nfor these entries.  Also, as far as possible, avoid entries in round figures e.g. Rs.1,00,000 , Rs. \\n2,50,000 , etc. unless you h ave supporting documents . Otherwise , it may lead to suspicion. If your \\nsponsor has more than one bank account, passbooks/account statements for all his bank accounts \\nmust be presented. Ideally, one should not have more than three  to four savings accounts. It is also \\nnecessary to carry original fixed -deposit receipts of all the banks and the PPF passbook , if any. Bank \\ndocuments in Marathi, Gujarati, and Hindi are also accepted at the US Consulate, Mumbai.  Very \\nrarely does a consulate officer demand a liquid back up for the second year of study.  \\n \\n Even if the student does not have adequate liquid assets, the consulate officer can grant a \\nvisa if the student gets admission into a good university , along with  an impressive GRE score \\nand academic background.  \\n \\n2. Income Tax Returns  \\nIncome tax returns of the last three fi nancial years are required (20 20-2021, 2021-2022. and 2022-\\n2023) There is no specific guideline regarding the taxable income of the sponsor, but ideally , it should \\nbe more than Rs.8,00,000 per annum. Otherwise , your visa application could  be rejected on the \\ngrounds of inadequate income.  \\n  \\n Salaried sponsors  are required to  have income tax returns and  a photocopy of Form 16 given by \\ntheir employer.  \\n  \\n Self-employed sponsors  (businessmen/professionals) must have their original income tax returns, \\nalong with  the computation of income, profit and loss account, and the balance sheet.  \\n \\n If the sponsor has retired  and does not fil e his income tax returns , the student should carry a letter \\nfrom the employer of the sponsor indicating all the retirement benefits he has received from the \\nemployer at the time of retirement. You can also carry the last income tax return filed by the sponsor.  \\n \\n If the sponsor is an NRI,  an income tax return is not required. Student s should carry a photocopy \\nof the sponsor’s passport, a letter from the employer abroad stating the sponsor’s annual income and \\noriginal bank statements from Indian as well as foreign banks, if any.  \\n \\n If the sponsor is a farmer  his agricultural income is not taxable. You should take a cer tificate from \\na Teh sildar of  your total land holdings and the annual income from the land. Relevant documents \\nregarding the land holding (7/12 extract) must be enclosed.  Your sponsor can al so obtain a certificate \\nfrom a chartered a ccountant certifying his annual income with a clear note that this', metadata={'source': 'VisaDocuments.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='DILIP OAK’S ACADEMY  \\n \\n11 \\n  income is not taxable. It is also possible to file a no -tax return for your agricultural  income in \\nconsultation with a chartered a ccountant.  \\n \\n In case of joint sponsors , income tax returns of all the sponsors are required.  \\n \\n3. Sponsor  \\n In most cases , the I-20 form does not mention the name of the sponsor but only states “family funds”. \\nDuring  the application  process , if you send  the bank letter of some one other than your parents, the \\nname of that person may be printed on the I -20 form. Nevertheless , at the time of visa interview , you \\ncan change the sponsor and show any other person/s , including your parents , as sponsor /s. \\n  \\n Generally,  the consulate officers accept both parents as joint sponsors. In such case s, the income s \\nof both parents can be clubbed together , if both parents are income tax payers.  If the income of your \\nparents is inadequate, any other family member , e.g. brother / sister  / grandfather  / grandmother can \\nsponsor you either individually or jointly . Even brothers or sisters of your parents  can sponsor you . \\nBut, in that case , they should have sufficient income and a substantial amount of liquid assets . \\n \\n If a close relative is not able to sponsor  you, you can take the sponsorship of any other known person \\nwith a sound income and substantial liquid assets. They must also give a letter explaining why they \\nare interested in sponsoring you. However,  it is entirely up to the discretion of the consulate officer \\nto accept a sponsor other than your parents . Therefore,  as far as possible , seek sponsorship from \\nyour parents or a fa mily member.  Show other sponsors only if it is unavoidable.  \\n \\n4. Probable Questions Asked b y the Consulate O fficer  \\n \\na) How many universities have you applied for?  \\nb) How many acceptances and rejections have you receive d? \\nc) Why have you selected this university?  \\nd) What is the profession of your sponsor and what is his income?  \\ne) How much money does he have in his bank account?  \\nf) Where are you working and what is your job profile ? \\n \\n In addition to these standard questions , consulate officer s may also ask other relevant question s. \\nYou must give honest and confident answer s. If your GRE score is more than 320 or if you are joining \\na high-ranked university, it is quite possible that the consulate officer may not ask for any documents \\nor ask too  many questions. The same applies to students who receive  full or substantial  financial \\nsupport from the universit y.  \\n \\n The consulate officer may check the following : \\nI. GRE and TOEFL scores  \\nII. Income of the sponsor declared as per income tax returns for the last three years.   \\nIII. Bank ba lance (saving as well as fixed) , and liquid assets.  \\n  \\n If the student is applying to an expensive university  (US $ 50,000 and above)  the visa officer is likely \\nto check the financial documents.', metadata={'source': 'VisaDocuments.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"DILIP OAK’S ACADEMY  \\n \\n14 \\n FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS  \\n \\nQ.1 What  is an form I-20 and how do I obtain it? \\nThe Form I -20 is an official US Government form, issued by a certified school, which a prospective non-\\nimmigrant  student must have in order to get an F -1 or M -1 visa. Form I -20 acts as proof -of-acceptance \\nand contai ns the information necessary to pay the SEVIS I -901 fee, apply for a visa , or change visa \\nstatus, and be admitted into the United States. The Form I -20 has the student's SEVIS identification \\nnumber, which starts with the letter N followed by 10 digits, on the top left-hand  side. \\n \\nQ.2 How early should I apply for my student (F1) visa?  \\nYou can apply for F1 visa any time after you receive I -20 form of the desired university.  \\n \\nQ.3 I received my visa, when should I travel?  \\nYou may only enter the United States within 30 days of the beginning of the course of study stated on \\nyour I -20 form, regardless of when your visa was issued.  \\n \\nQ.4 What if I receive the I-20 form to a different school?  \\nIf you receive an I -20 form after scheduling your appointment, then you can inform the US consular officer \\nof the new I -20 form at the time of the interview.  \\n \\nQ.5 I was working on an H -1B visa and have now been admitted to a university as an F -1. Do I \\nneed to return to my country to apply for a student visa?  \\nNo. Once you are in the United States, you do not need to apply for a new visa because the visa is only \\nfor entry into the United States. Check with USCIS to determine if you need to adjust the status  of your \\nexisting visa . If you  leave the country, however, you'll need to apply for the student visa in  your home \\ncountry in  order to re -enter the United States.  \\n \\nQ.6 What is the SEVIS system and how does it affect me?  \\nThe Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) program  requires schools and exchange \\nprograms to verify the enrolment  status of all new and continuing foreign students and exchange visitors. \\nStudent visa applicants are required to pay a SEVIS fee before a visa can be issued. Applicants are then \\nrequired to provide the SEVIS I -901 fee receipt as proof of payment. The SEVI S website has more details  \\non this . \\n \\nQ.7 Can my dependents apply for a tourist visa instead of dependent visa if they only want to visit \\nme and stay in U.S. for a short period of time?  \\nYes, they can apply for a Tourist visa.  \\n \\nQ.8 How do I read and understa nd my visa?  \\nAs soon as you receive your visa, check to make sure all your personal information printed on the visa is \\ncorrect. If any of the information on your visa does not match the information in your passport , or is \\notherwise incorrect, please contact  the issuing authority (i.e. the US Embassy) immediately.  \\n \\nThe expiry  date of your visa is the last day you may use the visa to enter the United States. It does not \\nindicate how long you may stay in the United States. Your stay is determined by the Departm ent of \\nHomeland Security at your port of entry. As long as you comply with the Department of Homeland Security \\ndecision on the conditions of your stay, you should have no problem.  Further information about \\ninterpreting your visa can be found at the Departm ent of State's Consular Affairs website.  \\n \\nQ.9 My visa will expire while I am in the United States. Is there a problem with that?  \\nNo. You may stay in the US for the period of time and conditions authori sed by the Department of \\nHomeland Security officer when  you arrived in the US, which will be noted on the I -94, even if your visa \\nexpires during your stay.  \\n \\nQ.10 What address should  I mention on Form DS -160, if my current home address and my address \\non the passport is not the same?  \\nYou must mention your current home address in India and not the address printed  on your passport.\", metadata={'source': 'VisaDocuments.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",
